# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Quality Prediction using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based solution to automatically predict the **quality of agricultural crops** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It aims to assist farmers, agritech startups, and food quality inspectors in identifying crop quality from images â€” ensuring faster and more reliable assessment.
